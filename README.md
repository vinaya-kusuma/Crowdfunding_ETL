# Project Description
In this project we have built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. 
The transformed data are created as four CSV files which is used to create an ERD and a table schema. 
Finally, we have uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database Crowdfundfunding_db.

# The project is divided into the following subsections:

Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
Create the Campaign DataFrame
Create the Contacts DataFrame
Create the Crowdfunding Database

# Files and folders uploaded

- Resources - Includes all the CSV/xlsx files
- ETL_Mini_Project_RRao_VKusuma.ipynb
- crowdfunding_db_schema.sql
- ERD.png

# Note 
- We have created the contacts dataframe using both the options but we have commented the code for option 2 - using regex
